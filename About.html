            <h1>Benefits of exercise</h1>
            <p>With exercise you maintain a physical shape - with exercise you challenge your physical shape and go
                outside your comfort zone. But despite the fact that science agrees that exercise in all forms is good
                for both body and soul, there are surprisingly many who do not take the time to squeeze the gym into
                their full schedule. And it's hard. Between work, family, friends and Friday coziness, there will not be
                much time left to pack your bag, get to the gym, work out, shower and change. In addition, the exercise
                must be planned, evaluated and developed. But you know it gives so much in return. The food tastes
                better, you wake up with more energy and the sun shines a little more often when you exercise regularly.
            </p>
